# GFit
#Take 2D-data, sum partly or completly in either direction to a 1D graph, and fit those with multiple Gaussians

This is a short interface written in pyqt5. Just download the two .py files, save 
them in the same directory and execute the gfit_main7.py. The gfit_main.ui file is necessary should you wish to 
add further functionality or change the layout of the program.
